## Overview
The [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is an important image classification dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks), with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.<br>

The **GOALS** of this project are to:
- Learn how to preprocess the image data
- Implement different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers using GPU-enabled Tensorflow and Keras API
- Compare different CNN architectures

**Tools:**
- GPU-enabled Tensorflow
- Keras API
